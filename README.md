# Advent of Code

Welcome to our Advent of Code GoLang Helper repository! 

This tool is designed to streamline your experience with the Advent of Code challenges, providing an automated way to fetch daily challenge inputs and descriptions directly from the website. To get started, first ensure you have GoLang installed on your system. 

Clone this repository to your local machine, and navigate to the repository directory. Before running the scripts, set your Advent of Code session token as an environment variable named TOKEN. This token is required for authentication and can be retrieved from your browser's cookies while logged into the Advent of Code website. 

Once set, you can use the cli.go script to download the challenge inputs and descriptions for any specific day by running go run `go run cli.go --year <year> --day <day>`. The script will create a directory for the specified year and day, save the challenge input as input.txt, the description as description.txt, and provide a basic main.go file template for you to start coding your solution. 

Happy coding and best of luck with the challenges!
