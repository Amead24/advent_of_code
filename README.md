# Advent of Code

Before running the scripts, set your Advent of Code session token as an environment variable named TOKEN. This token is required for authentication and can be retrieved from your browser's cookies while logged into the Advent of Code website.

Once set, you can use the cli.go script to download the challenge inputs and descriptions for any specific day by running go run `go run cli.go --year <year> --day <day>`. The script will create a directory for the specified year and day, save the challenge input as input.txt and provide a basic main.go file template for you to start coding your solution.
